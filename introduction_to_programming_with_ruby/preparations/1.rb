# Create a directory named my_folder and then navigate inside that directory. 
#   Create two files named one.rb and two.rb in the my_folder directory. Write a 
#   ruby program that outputs the line this is file one when you run the one.rb 
#   file. Then write another program that outputs this is file two when you run 
#   the two.rb file. (Hint: one.rb should have this in it puts "this is file 
#   one").

# In the command line type: mkdir my_folder
#   Next, create two new files using the touch command: touch one.rb two.rb
#   Open the file one.rb and create a string that outputs to the console using
#   the puts command: puts "this is file one"
#   Open the file two.rb and create a string that outputs to the console using
#   the puts command: puts "this is file two"

# To run the programs go to the command line and type enter: ruby one.rb or ruby
#   two.rb

# Note: I didn't create these files but I used the command line to create all of
#   the files used to complete the exercises in the book.
