# Let's move on now to the documentation you will use most often; the core API 
# section on Classes and Modules. All of these are listed under Classes on the 
# Core API page.

# Don't worry too much about the term class. For now, think of classes as data 
# types: numbers, character strings, arrays, hashes, etc.

# Locate and open the class documentation for the String class.
