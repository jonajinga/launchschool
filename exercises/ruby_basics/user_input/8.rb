# Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, then prints the 
# results of dividing the first by the second. The second number must not be 0. 
# Since this is user input, there's a good chance that the user won't enter a 
# valid integer. Therefore, you must validate the input to be sure it is an 
# integer. You can use the following code to determine whether the input is an 
# integer:

# It returns true if the input string can be converted to an integer and back to 
# a string without loss of information, false otherwise. It's not a perfect 
# solution in that some inputs that are otherwise valid (such as 003) will fail, 
# but it is sufficient for this exercise.

  number_string.to_i.to_s == number_string
